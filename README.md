This repo contains a collection of my own notes taken from the above Udemy course. None of the code was directly copy and pasted, but rather meticulously hand-typed following along through the videos.

Much of these small projects contain my own personal flair of formatting and changes in design from the origial repo. For many of the projects, I went futher than the original course by creating a more robust UI making if more difficult for a real-life user to break the inferface leading to a more realistic UX.
